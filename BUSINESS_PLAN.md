# SaturnOS 2.0 Business Plan (Lean)

## Executive summary
SaturnOS 2.0 is an enterprise-ready annotation and SOP-driven QA platform with AI assistance. The business focuses on predictable token spend, compliance-friendly workflows, and team collaboration. Pricing is intentionally low to win mid-market teams and expand into enterprise via usage-based growth.

## Product positioning
- "Enterprise-ready AI workspace with predictable token spend + governance."
- Core value: SOP-driven QA workflows, consistent annotations, and model training visibility.
- Differentiator: pooled token allowances, audit-ready logs, and controlled AI usage.

## Target customers
- Primary: mid-market and enterprise QA teams (20-2,000 seats).
- Secondary: regulated industries needing auditability and SOP compliance.
- Buyer: QA leaders, operations managers, and technical program owners.

## Pricing strategy (low price, premium API)
Assumes a blended model cost of ~$0.50 per 1M tokens (industry average mix of small/medium models).

### Tiers (no API access by default)
- Free: 25k tokens/mo, 1 workspace, community support, no API.
- Starter: $15/user/mo, 250k tokens/mo pooled, 3 workspaces, email support.
- Team: $39/user/mo, 2M tokens/mo pooled, SSO, audit logs, priority support.
- Enterprise: custom annual, starting ~$4k/mo, 50M tokens/mo pooled, SLA, security review, dedicated CSM.

### API dashboard (premium add-on)
- Pro/Starter add-on: $49/org/mo + $1.00 per 1M tokens.
- Team: API dashboard included, usage $0.90 per 1M tokens.
- Enterprise: included, volume rates from $0.60 per 1M tokens.

### Overage policy (non-API)
- Starter: $1.10 per 1M tokens.
- Team: $0.95 per 1M tokens.
- Enterprise: negotiated.

## Revenue model
- Per-seat subscriptions + pooled token allowances + overages.
- Enterprise contracts annual with minimum commitment.
- Optional API add-on expands ACV without changing core product.

## Go-to-market plan
- Phase 1: self-serve Starter/Team with clear token dashboards.
- Phase 2: sales-assisted pilots (2-4 weeks) for enterprise proof.
- Phase 3: expansion via usage-based overages and seat growth.

## Operating plan
- Keep inference costs low using tiered model routing (small model default, escalate on demand).
- Maintain compliance posture (SSO, audit logs, access controls).
- Optimize storage costs with retention policies and lifecycle rules.

## Key metrics
- Activation rate (first project + SOP processed).
- Token utilization (included vs overage).
- Expansion ARR from overages and seats.
- Time-to-value and retention.

## Risks and mitigations
- Cost spikes: enforce rate limits, hard caps, and alerting.
- Enterprise security needs: prioritize SSO, audit logs, and SOC2 roadmap.
- Competition: win on cost predictability and SOP-first workflows.

## 12-month roadmap (business)
- Q1: launch pricing, token dashboard, API add-on billing.
- Q2: enterprise pilots, audit logging, SSO hardening.
- Q3: compliance milestones (SOC2 readiness), partner channels.
- Q4: expand enterprise deals, introduce volume discounts.
